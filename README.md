## Why Use This?

If you’re an **[Up Bank](https://up.com.au/)** user who loves **[Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server)**, you’ve probably:
- Wasted time manually exporting CSV files
- Forgotten to sync transactions for weeks
- Felt frustrated by Actual Budget’s lack of direct integration

This tool solves those problems by automating everything. No more spreadsheets!

## Quickstart (Docker Recommended)

### 1. Pull Docker Image
The docker image is hosted on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/nodemana/actualbudgetupimporter/tags.

`docker pull nodemana/actualbudgetupimporter:latest`

### 2. Obtain Up Bank API Key:
- Log in to your Up Bank online banking portal.
- Navigate to the developer section (may vary depending on Up Bank's interface).
- Generate a new API key and copy it for later use.

### 3. Obtain Actual Budget Credentials:
- Log in to your Actual Budget account.
- Top left click your budget -> Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Then record your Sync ID.
- Locate your Actual Budget Account IDs. (These are IDs for each of your individual on or off budget accounts).

### 4. Set up your `.env` File
```# .env
ACTUAL_BUDGET_ID="your_sync_id"
ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASSWORD="your_password"
UP_BANK_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_up_api_key"
ACTUAL_BUDGET_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:5006"  # Change if hosted
ACTUAL_BUDGET_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="your_E2E_encryption_password"
UP_BANK_SYNC_START="your_sync_start_date" # Date & time in rfc-3339 format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[Z or +HH:MM]
```

### 5. Run the container to get your accound ID's
Now we need to run the docker image so that we can extract our account id's.

`docker run --env-file .env nodemana/actualbudgetupimporter:latest`

if you are running actual budget server on your local machine then you will need to pass --network="host"
So you would run:

`docker run --env-file .env --network="host" nodemana/actualbudgetupimporter:latest`

**(This will fail but print your Up/Actual Budget account IDs – copy these)**

### 5. Update `.env` with account mappings:
Record these in your .env files like so:
```
# left is up id, right is actual budget id
UP_ACCOUNT_MAPPING={"up_account1": "actual_budget_account1","up_account2": "actual_budget_account1"}
```
⚠️ **Security Note**:  
Never commit your `.env` file or share API keys. Up Bank tokens have full read access to your transactions!

Explanation of `UP_ACCOUNT_MAPPING`: This section is crucial for mapping your Up Bank accounts to the correct accounts in Actual Budget. You need to replace the placeholder IDs with your actual IDs. For example:
```
{
  "12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-1234567890ab": "98765432-zyxw-vuts-rqpo-0987654321dc",
  "98765432-zyxw-vuts-rqpo-0987654321dc": "56789012-lkjh-gfed-cba9-2109876543fe"
}
```

This maps the Up Bank account with ID `12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-1234567890ab` to the Actual Budget account with ID `98765432-zyxw-vuts-rqpo-0987654321dc`, and so on. You can add as many mappings as you'd like.

### 6. Run the final container
Now we have all the variables we need, we can now run the docker container in the background:

`docker run -d --env-file .env --network="host" nodemana/actualbudgetupimporter:latest`

**Done!** Transaction sync hourly.

<summary>Source Code Installation Steps</summary>

#### 1. Clone the Repository:
- Open a terminal window (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux). You can use a free online terminal emulator if you don't have one installed.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to download the project files. Then, run the following command to clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ActualBudget-UpBank-TransactionImporter.git```

- Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

#### 2. Install nvm:
  - Open a terminal window.
  - Run the following command to download and install the nvm script: **NOTE You will need a WSL terminal if on Windows.**

    `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`

    Note: Replace v0.39.3 with the latest nvm version number if you prefer. Check the official nvm GitHub repository for the latest version: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
  - Close and reopen your terminal window for the changes to take effect. 

#### 3. Verify nvm installation:
- Run the following command to check if nvm is installed correctly:
    `nvm -v`
This should print the installed nvm version.

#### 4. Install Node.js version 18.14.1:
- Use the following command to install Node.js version 18.14.1:
  `nvm install 18.14.1`

#### 5. Verify Node.js installation:
- Run the following commands to verify the installed Node.js version and npm version:
```
node -v
npm -v
```
These should print v18.14.1 for Node.js and the corresponding npm version.

#### 6. Install Project Dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned repository directory using the cd command in your terminal. Then, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

`npm install`
This will download and install all the necessary libraries needed for the script to function.

#### 7. Obtain Up Bank API Key:
- Log in to your Up Bank online banking portal.
- Navigate to the developer section (may vary depending on Up Bank's interface).
- Generate a new API key and copy it for later use.

#### 8. Obtain Actual Budget Credentials:
- Log in to your Actual Budget account.
- Navigate to your profile settings.
- Locate your Actual Budget ID (a unique identifier for your account).
- Locate your Actual Budget Account IDs. (These are IDs for each of your individual on or off budget accounts).

#### 9. In The autorun.sh File:
- In the project's root directory (where you cloned the repository), there is a file called autorun.sh. This file is used to store sensitive information like API keys and passwords securely and is the entry point of the automated script.
- Open the autorun.sh file with a text editor and add your credentials to the other side of the equals signs:

```
export ACTUAL_BUDGET_ID=
export ACTUAL_BUDGET_PASSWORD=
export ACTUAL_BUDGET_SERVER_URL=    # http://localhost:5006
export ACTUAL_BUDGET_UP_ACCOUNT_ID=

# left is up id, right is actual budget id
export UP_ACCOUNT_MAPPING='{
    "up_account1": "actual_budget_account1",
    "up_account2": "actual_budget_account1"
}'

export UP_BANK_ACCESS_TOKEN=

```
**Important**: Never commit this file to your version control system (e.g., GitHub) as it contains sensitive information.

#### 10. Running the Script (Simplified Method):

Option 1: Manual Execution

Open a terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the following command to execute the script:
`./autorun.sh`

Option 2: Scheduled Execution (Recommended - Cron Job)

To automate the script to run periodically (e.g., daily), you can use cron (on Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).

Example Cron Job (runs daily at 3:00 AM):
- Open your crontab for editing:
    `crontab -e`
- Add the following line to the crontab (adjust the path to your autorun.sh script):
`0 3 * * * /path/to/your/project/autorun.sh`
- Replace `/path/to/your/project/autorun.sh` with the absolute path to the autorun.sh file. You can get the absolute path by running pwd in your project directory and then appending /autorun.sh.

Explanation of the Cron Expression:
- 0: Minute (0-59)
- 3: Hour (0-23)
- *: Day of the month (1-31)
- *: Month (1-12)
- *: Day of the week (0-6, Sunday is 0)

This setup will run the script every day at 3:00 AM.
